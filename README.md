I designed this portfolio in my Ux course. I tried to use the modern tecnigue and avoiding to usual metodes. I wanted to design a simple yet beautiful portfolio. In this work, I have tried to use all the material I have learned so far, such as grid, flexbox, animation, and bootstrap. Of course, this is not perfect and there is room for improvement. I will show this portfolio to several people to get the best results using different opinions.
