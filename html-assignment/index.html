            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
            I studied graphic design in my home town and I worked in this feld for several
            years. I have experience in a magazine and book layout, poster, catalog and book cover design.
        </p>
        <p>Exept for all kinds of design, <q>traveling</q> and being in nature is my other favorite in my life
            Also, now I feel I love <b>coding</b> too.
