            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
            I studied <em>graphic design</em> in my home town and I worked in this feld for several
            years. I have experience in a magazine and book layout, poster, catalog and book cover design,
            press and prepress proses. In addintion, I like <q>drowing Sketch</q> from nature and people.


        </p>
        <p>Exept for all kinds of design, <q>traveling</q> and being in nature is my other favorite in my life.
            Maybe because of this reason I like photography, but I prefer to take pictures only for myself no 
            for my job. In addition, now I feel I love <b>coding</b>, and maybe this field
            will be my future job.
