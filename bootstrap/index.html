            <h5 class="mt-4 alert alert-info">What is Bootstrap?</h5>
            <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

            As of April 2021, Bootstrap is the tenth most starred project on GitHub, with more than 150,000 stars, behind freeCodeCamp (almost 312,000 stars), Vue.js framework, React library, TensorFlow and others.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-4 alert alert-info">Simplifying the development</h5>
            <p>Bootstrap is a HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages.The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-4 alert alert-info">Layout Components</h5>
            <p>The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web page. The basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. Developers can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container. While the latter always fills the width of the web page, the former uses one of the five predefined fixed widths, depending on the size of the screen showing the page</p>

        <div class="col mt-5">
            <h5 class="alert alert-info">Grid</h5>
            <p>Bootstrap has the capability to utilize a 12-column grid that is responsive. It also upholds offset and nested elements. The grid can be maintained in a responsive mode, or you can simply modify it to a secured layout.</p>

        <div class="col mt-5">
            <h5 class="alert alert-info">Alert</h5>
            <p>Bootstrap provides an easy way to create predefined alert messages:
            Success! This alert box indicates a successful or positive action.
            Info! This alert box indicates a neutral informative change or action.
            Warning! This alert box indicates a warning that might need attention.
            Danger! This alert box indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action.
            Alerts are created with the <b>.alert class</b>, followed by one of the four contextual classes <b>.alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning</b> or <b>.alert-danger</b>

            <h5 class="alert alert-info">Easily Customizable</h5>
            <p>Despite the fact that Bootstrap is designed in responsive 12-column grids, layouts, and components, it is also very easy to customize. Whether you need a fixed grid or a responsive one, it can be made possible by making a few changes. Offsetting and nesting of columns are also easy to do in both CPU-based and mobile-based browser grids</p>
